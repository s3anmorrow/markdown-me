# Markdown Me
Converts my lesson plans from DOCS to Markdown for the big migration away from stupid MS Word (why did it take me so long?)

## Usage
Copy the extract.py file into each unit folder of a course and run with command:
```
python md-me.py
``` 
The script will go through all word document files and convert them to markdown and do some minor formatting fixes.

## Requirements
- Pandoc (https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/ or install via MS Store)
