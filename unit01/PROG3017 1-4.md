## Instructional Procedures:

PORTING OVER QUOTE GENERATOR

- first lesson we developed /quoteGenerator using Vanilla JS

- second lesson we modified workflow to use docker to spin up two
containers

- this lesson will port over the client side from Vanilla JS to React

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- spin up ubuntu on WSL by opening a terminal to ubuntu

	- run command in terminal to create new project folder via github:

```
git clone <https://github.com/s3anmorrow/PROG3017-boilerplate.git>
```

	- recall this boilerplate is built using create-react-app

	- rename folder to quote-generator-react:

```
mv PROG3017-boilerplate quote-generator-react
```

	- download dependencies with commands:

```
cd client
npm install
```

	- copy /api folder from /quoteGenerator into /quote-generator-react

	- open project folder with command:

```
code quote-generator-react
```

- original web app used Sass, but create-react-app integrates CSS by
default

- next lesson we will be porting app over to Tailwind CSS

- for now, will use standard CSS to style quote generator

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- point out styles.css is CSS equivalent of styles.scss (original web
app)

	- because react is component based, will break up styling

	- copy html / body style from styles.css and overwrite index.css
styles

	- index.css is main stylesheet for global styles of web app

	- point out index.css is imported in index.tsx for webpack to bundle
it

	- copy rest of styles in styles.css into app.css (exclude
.loading-overlay)

	- point out app.css is imported in app.tsx

	- open terminal in VS Code (make sure it is the ubuntu terminal)

	- build images and fire up containers:

```
sudo docker compose up --build
```

	- point out when pulling from a github rep, sudo is required in
command otherwise the container startup fails

	- hit React Web app at http://localhost:3000

INTRODUCTION TO COMPONENTS

- component structure of React is its best feature -- are the building
blocks

- previous example we created / rendered elements to the DOM using
React.createElement() / ReactDOM.createRoot() and then dabbled in JSX

- a typical react web app is made up of several components (but at
least one)

	- a component is class or function that optionally accepts input and
returns its UI (as JSX)

	- are meant to be completely self-contained in terms of styling,
functionality, etc. (this rule is broken sometimes)

	- can be developed as a class component (OOP approach) or as a
function component (Functional approach)

	- functional approach is more popular and with recent updates almost
as versatile as OOP approach

	- will be using functional approach during this course

- create-react-app adds a single component App.tsx

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- open index.tsx

	- point out React and ReactDOM imported by default

	- point out importing App() function from App.tsx

	- point out ReactDom.createRoot() / root.render() to render out some
JSX to \<div id="root"- on public/index.html (same as last lesson)

	- point out \<React.StrictMode\>

	- highlights potential problems and throws errors and warnings

	- is the main entry point of the react web app

	- point out \<App /- (could be written \<App\>\</App\>) in JSX

	- this element runs the App() function of App.tsx and returns JSX
which is rendered to \<div id="root"\>

	- App is the root component - contains the entire web app

	- open App.tsx

	- point out App component has its own stylesheet App.css

	- point out App() function and replace return value to (copy from
index.html of quoteGenerator):

```
return (
<main>
<header>_Quote Generator</header>
<div className="quotes">
</div>
<footer>Powered by <a
href="http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener
noreferrer">quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/</a></footer>
</main>
);
```

	- point out this is a block of JSX

	- point out wavy red lines on class attributes:

	- despite JSX looking like HTML it isn't (is JS under the hood)

	- class is a keyword in JS and thus you can't use it in JSX

	- convert all class to "className"

	- since functions are objects in JS this can be written like this:

```
const App = function() {
```

	- or with an anonymous function like this:

```
const App = () =- {
```

	- this is how most developers define functions in React web apps

	- delete logo.svg from project folder and remove import from App.tsx

	- run web app

	- to recap:

	- react pulls in App component and merges it all together, webpack
transpiles all TS to ES5 and bundles JS and CSS, and spins up local
server that is running on the my-client-server container

	- point out header / footer of quoteGenerator is now ported over to
React!

CUSTOM FUNCTIONS IN COMPONENTS

- the root component needs to do more!

- the quoteGenerator requires JSON to be fetched and three distinct
quotes selected for display

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- start by having quote JSON data hardcoded as a preliminary step

	- add variable outside App() and paste all content from quotes.json:

```
// quote data hardcoded for testing purposes
const quotesArchive:any = [JSON data here]
```

	- point out global variable is temporary and will be removed in later
lesson

	- point out variable declaration with type any:

	- a specialized datatype in TS so it plays nice with traditional JS

	- the JSON requires a datatype (Class to define it)

	- a way of opting out of datatype for everything

	- is cheating and will fix in later lesson

	- to select three random quotes we need getRandom() from Toolkit.ts

	- copy provided Toolkit.ts to src/tools and add import to top:

```
import { getRandom } from "./tools/Toolkit";
```

	- will isolate code to randomly select quotes in a custom function
(method)

	- add custom function to App() above return statement:

```
const refreshQuotes = (count:number) =- {
}
```

	- point out done with arrow function approach

	- point out refreshQuotes() is a function inside the App() function

	- because it is declared inside App() it is only callable inside
App()

	- is how custom functions are added to React function components

	- scope is all defined by closures (curly braces)

	- point out count argument:

	- for future proofing so the function will return any number of
randomly selected quotes

	- add into refreshQuotes():

```
let quotesSelectedFromPool:any = [];
// build quotes array to be displayed
for (let n:number=0; n<count; n++) {
// randomly pick index of quote in JSON data
let index:number = getRandom(0, quotesArchive.length - 1);
// add quote to quotes array
quotesSelectedFromPool.push(quotesArchive[index]);
}
return quotesSelectedFromPool;
```

	- point out quotesSelectedFromPool scope is inside refreshQuotes()

	- point out using getRandom() to select quotes and pushing into array
and eventually returning that array

	- let's use the newly added function -- add above return statement:

```
let quotesSelected:any = refreshQuotes(3);
console.table(quotesSelected);
console.log(quotesSelected);
```

	- run web app to test random quotes selected and displayed in console

	- point out appears twice - the web app is being loaded twice?

	- is occurring because of \<React.StrictMode- in Index.tsx as part
of debugging

	- App() running twice

	- production version would not do this

	- functions of functional components are called a lot -- it's ok!

NESTED COMPONENTS

- the last piece is to display the three quotes selected

- with Vanilla JS we cloned a node (HTML), populated, and added to a
\<div\>

	- still need to do this, but is much more structured with React

- we could hammer this out all in the single App root component -- but
is better to modularize/isolate in its own component

- will call it the Content component

	- will be rendered out three times on the App component (root)

	- hence Content component is a nested component

	- nesting components is a common pattern in React

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- add a Content.tsx to src/Content/

	- add a Content.css to src/Content

	- recall components have all required styling in their own stylesheet

	- technically all CSS styles are bundled into one stylesheet that is
shared by all components -- BUT it is best practise to isolate styles
according to component usage

	- as a result, sometimes redundancy exists across component
stylesheets

	- move over .template style classes from App.css to here

	- add to Content.tsx:

```
import React from \'react\';
import "./Content.css";
const Content = () =- {
return (
<div className="template">
<div className="template__message">???</div>
<div className="template__author">???</div>
<div className="template__link"><a href="#">???</a></div>
</div>
);
}
export default Content;
```

	- point out JSX is .template \<div\> of index.html of /quoteGenerator

	- point out importing component's CSS stylesheet

	- point out exporting to module system so Content can be imported

	- point out class attributes renamed to className

	- point out temporary content for quote with ??? (will fix later)

	- let's nest this component into our App component

	- add import to top of App.tsx:

```
import Content from "./Content/Content";
```

	- add to JSX inside .quotes \<div\>:

```
<div className="content">
{quotesSelected.map(
(quoteData:any) =- <Content />
)}
</div>
```

	- remember that quoteData is each element of the quotesSelected array

	- "any" datatype is temporary until JSON is datatyped (later lesson)

	- run web app and demo Content component being nested and rendered
three times (ignore warning about "key" for now)

COMPONENT PROPERTIES

- Content component needs the quote data from quotesSelected array so
it can display it in its JSX

- easiest way to pass data into a component is as properties

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- add argument to Content() function of Content.tsx:

```
const Content = (props:any) =- {
```

	- using "any" datatype - temporary!

	- all properties set on Content component is received by props
argument

	- is a generic object with properties set to the same names

	- add to map() method of App.tsx:

```
{quotesSelected.map(
(quoteData:any) =- <Content message={quoteData.quote}
author={quoteData.author} link={quoteData.permalink} />
)}
```

	- point out defining properties and using interpolation to set values

	- next is to use properties in Content component's JSX

	- use object destructing to isolate the properties -- add to
Content():

```
// get properties passed in
const { message, author, link } = props;
```

	- we need to at least get rid of the "any" datatype in the props
argument

	- modify to:

```
const Content = (props:{ message:string, author:string, link:string })
=- {
```

	- point out datatyping a generic object's properties

	- one step further - most React developers would code the props
argument so it declares the types and destructures them in one line:

```
const Content = ({ message, author, link }:{ message:string,
author:string, link:string }) =- {
```

	- can delete destructuring line if using this approach

	- and use the props in the returned JSX with interpolation:

```
<div className="content__message">{message}</div>
<div className="content__author">{author}</div>
<div className="content__link"><a
href={link}>{link}</a></div>
```

	- run web app

	- this technique of getting data from a parent component to a nested
child component is called property drilling

	- in this app there is only one nested component -- but large ones
have several layers of components

	- open console in chrome and point out warning:

	- since we are rendering three \<Content- components below, React
throws an error that each child needs a unique key property

	- to fix this add a key property with a unique value to component
element

	- modify map() method:

```
{quotesSelected.map(
(quoteData:any, i:number) =- <Content key={i}
message={quoteData.quote} author={quoteData.author}
link={quoteData.permalink} />
)}
```

	- point out map() method anonymous function has a second argument
which is a counter (much like for loop)

	- point out using i as unique value of key property

	- run web app

- we are not finished with this port over to React -- continue next
lesson!

CHALLENGE : Tweaking for Distinct Quotes

- we are well on our way to migrating over the Quote Generator to a
React web app -- let's clean up the functionality a bit!

- as noted in a previous lesson, the quote generator randomly selects
three random quotes, but there is the chance that duplicates might occur

- modify the quote-generator-react web app so that all displayed quotes
are distinct

- this is best tested by increasing the number of quotes displayed on
the page to ten or more

- see /quote-generator-react for solution
