CHALLENGE : Finish off the React Portfolio Web App

- with both the Quote Generator / Pizzaria Delivery app migrated to
React we have a good handle on basic component structure

- let's practise some more by porting over the Portfolio Sampler from
last year to a React web app

- carefully study the provided /portfolio-react project folder - the
basic approach is the same as we have done previously

- build the docker images and run the containers and you will notice
that I have included a container for the Web API as well as a container
for the MySQL database

- the web app works, but only includes the "Selected View"

- your challenge is to add the much needed "All View" component to the
web app that displays all the portfolio samples in a vertical
arrangement on the page

- remember that this new component will need all the same data as the
SelectedView component

- for tailwind styling / HTML be sure to reference the original
provided /portfolio web app we implemented with Vanilla JS

- once the new component is added, implement the radio buttons on the
App component so that the SelectedView and AllView components are made
visible and invisible accordingly. In the original Vanilla JS /portfolio
we did this by adjusting visible style properties -- use this same
approach for the react version. For this example, you can either unmount
/ mount the component or make it invisible / visible.

- this challenge is worth 2 tickies
