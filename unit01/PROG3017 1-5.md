## Instructional Procedures:

INTRODUCTION TO TAILWIND CSS

- is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4,
text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design,
directly in your markup

- what is utility first?

	- tailwind provides a low-level style class for everything you need
for styling which means you can do all the styling within the HTML

	- tailwind style classes are referred to as utilities

	- style classes have clear names with clear intent and mirror CSS
styles for easy learning

- tailwind CSS eliminates the need for a stylesheet

- isn't doing all styling with inline styling in HTML bad form?

	- modern JS frameworks like React / Angular are component based

	- each component needs to be standalone units

	- by removing the need for a stylesheet, it makes this more possible
and eliminates redundancy across multiple component stylesheets

- evolution of CSS:

	- inline styling with style="" in HTML

	- isolating styling in external CSS stylesheet

	- pre-processing external CSS stylesheet from Sass / Less to CSS for
added features

	- inline styling with Tailwind CSS (full circle!)

- how does it work?

	- tailwind analyzes HTML / JS files of web app and generates CSS
based on findings

	- therefore, like Sass, it needs a build process

	- it is customizable in theme section of the config file -- but is so
flexible that is usually not required

TAILWIND PROJECT SETUP

- tailwind CSS works with a react app generated with create-react-app

- will demo with our existing quote generator

- demo to students with /quote-generator-react:

	- need Tailwind CSS support for intellisense in VS Code

	- install tailwind CSS intellisense extension

	- add Tailwind CSS and other dependencies to the client side React
app

	- open terminal and enter:

cd client

npm install \--save-dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

	- to generate the tailwind config files run command:

npx tailwindcss init -p

	- point out new tailwind.config.js / postcss.config.js

	- remember npx is like npm except runs an executable from npm repo

	- open tailwind.config.js and add to content\[\] array:

...

content: \[

\"./src/\*\*/\*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\",

\],

...

	- this outlines the location of files where tailwind utilities could
be added

	- will be adding tailwind utilities (styles) to HTML in JSX of the
tsx files

	- other file types added in case any contain JSX

	- need to import the Tailwind CSS library into the web app for use

	- replace all styling content of client/src/index.css and replace
with:

/\* importing Tailwind CSS libraries \*/

\@tailwind base;

\@tailwind components;

\@tailwind utilities;

	- ignore "unknown" warning

	- delete client/src/app.css and client/src/content/content.css

	- remove import statements in app.tsx / content.tsx

	- run docker as per normal:

docker-compose up \--build

	- see brightspace for newboilerplate github repo of the project
folder at:

https://github.com/s3anmorrow/PROG3017-boilerplate-with-Tailwind

PORTING OVER QUOTE GENERATOR TO TAILWIND

- with all styling removed, need to rebuild styling with tailwind --
with some extra added styling

- demo to students with /quoteGenerator-react:

	- open up quoteGeneratorReference.png for reference

	- point out font face and size are set (arial) by tailwind -- but
styling is missing otherwise

	- start with adding padding around web app

	- modify \<main- in app.tsx:

\<main className=\"p-5\"\>

	- point out p-5 utility is for adding padding on all sides

	- size is 20px or 1.25rem

	- recall rem is root em -- is ratio of the root font size (16px)

	- using rem helps ensure consistency of font size and spacing

	- there are utilities to add padding to targeted sides as well

	- point out rolling over utility will display the style properties
thanks to intellisense extension

	- run working web app

	- how do we know about this utility?

	- open tailwind API and enter padding into search:

<https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first>

	- rely heavily on API since there are too many utilities to retain

	- change text size a little smaller:

\<main className=\"p-5 text-sm\"\>

	- pause when typing "text" to demo intellisense menu of utilities to
choose

	- run working web app

	- stylize \<header\>:

\<header className=\"font-bold text-xl pb-3\"\>

	- point out pb-3 adds padding to bottom only (12px / 0.75rem)

	- run working web app

	- stylize \<footer\>:

\<footer className=\"mt-10\"\>

	- point out adding margin top (40px / 2.5rem)

	- run working web app

	- zoom our web app and point out content extends too wide

	- stylize \<div className="quotes"\>:

\<div className=\"max-w-xl\"\>

	- point out removing all custom style classes and replacing with
tailwind utilities

	- run working web app

	- stylize \<div className="content"\>:

\<div className=\"divide-dotted divide-y-2 divide-zinc-400\"\>

	- divide-dotted is the border style of the children elements

	- divide-y-2 sets horizontal border line to 2px between the children
elements

	- the y indicates the children are stacked vertically and border is
horizontal to separate them

	- this utility is quite powerful -- have students look at style
properties when rolling over divide-y-s

	- recall inside this \<div\> react will drop multiple \<div\>s for
each quote (via Content component)

	- point out setting divide color with divide-zinc-400

	- start by typing divide and scroll down in intellisense menu to find
color you want

	- large collection of color utilities

	- for complete list, search divide-color in API

	- run working web app

- let's cleanup the styling of the quotes themselves

- demo to students with /quoteGenerator-react:

	- open Content.tsx

	- stylize \<div className=\"template\"\>:

\<div className=\"pb-4 pt-4\"\>

	- point out adjusting both top and bottom padding -- can shorten to:

\<div className=\"py-4\"\>

	- run working web app

	- stylize quote content:

\<div className=\"italic\"\>{message}\</div\>

\<div className=\"font-bold\"\>{author}\</div\>

	- run working web app

	- stylize quote link:

\<div className=\"text-sky-600 text-xs hover:underline pt-1\"\>\<a
href=\"{link}\"\>{link}\</a\>\</div\>

	- point out changing color with a utility (this time for text)

	- point out pseudoclass hover included inline -- not possible without
stylesheet before Tailwind (state-variant)

	- run working web app

	- we need to go back to App.tsx and fix the link in the footer to
match the quote link:

\<a href=\"http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/\" target=\"\_blank\"
rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-sky-600
hover:underline\"\>quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/\</a\>

- have only scratched the surface with tailwind CSS:

	- includes utilities for handling responsive design (flex / CSS Grid)

	- done in later lessons

	- can customize any utility by modifying the tailwind.config.js file

	- if you have fifty buttons that each need ten utilities -- you can
create your own style class (utility)

	- add to index.css:

\@layer components {

.myStyleClass {

\@apply

\... list tailwind utilities here

}

}

	- will explore more utilities as we work through lessons in coming
weeks

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

- advantages of tailwind?

	- no more wasting time naming style classes -- can abandon BEM

	- reads better

	- no more CSS stylesheet that grows uncontrollably with each feature

	- making style changes feels safer -- is not global like CSS
stylesheets

	- CSS is super small (\~10K usually) -- only includes what is used

- disadvantages of tailwind?

	- requires build tools (webpack)

	- leads to a lot of redundancy in styling - with component nature of
React not a big deal

CHALLENGE : Adding a Controls Component

- we will be adding some new features to the Quote Generator during the
next lesson

- these new features require a new component be added that contains
some user controls (dropdown menu and checkbox) -- this new component
has been loosely developed and provided to you. See Controls.tsx

- the first step is to add the Controls component to the app and adjust
App.tsx so the component is rendered just below the Quote Generator
header

- when you run the app, you will notice that the controls in this new
component are not styled in any way

- the second step is to style the controls in this component using
Tailwind CSS

- When complete it should look close to the following:
