## Instructional Procedures:

SINGLE PAGE WEB APP REVIEW

- start by building a simple single page application using many techs
from PROG2700 Client Side Programming

- will be a quote generator app that will retrieve three random quotes
from a public Web API

WORKFLOW SETUP

- is our workflow setup to do this?

- install VS Code

	- install extension:

JSHint (by Dirk Baeumer)

- recall SPAs use a lot of technology to streamline the development
process:

	- Javascript (ECMAScript)

	- JSHint (checking our code for well-formed strict JS)

	- Sass (CSS Pre-processor for powerful stylesheets)

	- Babel to transpile ES2015 to ES8 for older browsers

	- Webpack to bundle up all the JS/CSS and make workflow with all
these tools seamless

	- requires Node.js to run webpack and require the Node Package
Manager (NPM) that comes with it

- is the lab setup correctly? If no then...

	- install git via

<https://git-scm.com/>

	- install latest LTS Node.js via

<https://nodejs.org/en/>

	- install JSHint - run command:

```
npm install --g jshint
```

	- restart VS Code

- start by building our project folder called /quoteGenerator -- add
subfolders:

/src -- for JS (ES8) files

/sass -- for SCSS files (Sass)

/html -- for the HTML files

/lib -- for all non-code assets of your web app (images)

- copy into root of project folder provided files:

package.json

	- outlines all dependencies needed by webpack and our web app

	- point out webpack, babel, sass, etc.

webpack.config.js

	- webpack setup and config to bundle up JS / CSS / SCSS and run tasks

- copy into /html:

index.html

	- completed HTML for web app using BEM notation / semantic tags
(main, header, footer), and Flexbox page layout

	- point out quoteTemplate \<div- that will be cloned and added to
the content \<div- in \<body- for each quote

- copy Sass stylesheet into /sass:

styles.scss

- copy custom JS library into /src folder

Toolkit.js

- open the project folder with VS Code and run command:

```
npm install
```

- goes through package.json and downloads all dependencies listed into
node_modules folder

- package.json also includes settings for JSHint

USING GIT WITH VS CODE

- project folder created, would be a good time to do version control!

	- we practised GIT via command line with Java last semester

	- VS Code makes it easier -- know your commands though!

- knowing GIT commands is a required skill, VS Code simplifies
initializing, committing, etc.

- demo to students:

	- open source control panel in VS Code / "Initialize Repository"
button to initialize GIT repo

	- adds the git repo into the project folder

	- a message will appear that there are too many files because of huge
node_modules folder -- click yes

	- will automatically add .gitignore to project folder and setup
/node_modules to be ignored

	- if not auto refreshed - click refresh button on version control
panel and most files disappear or restart VS Code

	- git needs to know who we are -- run commands in terminal:

```
git config --global user.email <s3anmorrow@gmail.com>
git config --global user.name "Sean Morrow"
```

	- to commit, type in message "project folder setup" and click
checkmark

	- may ask you if you want to stage all files -- click yes or always
(depending)

	- you can still run GIT commands in the terminal like normal

	- we want to work on a separate branch ("working") other than master

	- enter into terminal:

```
git branch
git branch working
git checkout working
```

	- three commands above can be done with ... button / branch / create
branch

	- can now code and commit to this branch

QUOTE GENERATOR SPA BUILD

- create new file src/main.js

- demo to students with main.js:

	- add import of styles.scss so webpack bundles it up into bundle.css:

```
// importing the sass stylesheet for bundling
import "./../sass/styles.scss";
```

	- import getJSONData() method from the custom Toolkit library
(module):

```
// module imports
import { getJSONData } from "./Toolkit";
```

	- import the Spinner class from the Spin.js library -- add to top:

```
import { Spinner } from "spin.js";
```

	- Spin.js is a JS library that requires its own CSS file -- we need
to have webpack include that in the bundle as well

	- add to top:

```
// importing Spin.js CSS library
import "./../node_modules/spin.js/spin.css";
```

	- demo to students in a browser:

```
http://www.seanmorrow.ca/_lessons/getQuotes.php
```

	- point out hitting a Web API written in PHP (server sided script)
that generates the JSON format data to be returned

	- add constant to main.js:

```
// quotes api url
const QUOTE_API = "https://www.seanmorrow.ca/_lessons/getQuotes.php";
```

	- add to main.js:

```js
// construct Spinner object (spin.js) and add to loadingOverlay <div>
let spinner = new Spinner({ color: "#a4c7e5", lines: 12
}).spin(document.querySelector(".loading-overlay"));
```

	- constructs Spinner object to be displayed on the loading-overlay
\<div\>

	- Spinner class was imported at top of main.js

	- builds a spinner animation via SVG and a linked in CSS file

	- Spin.js library used many times in PROG2700

	- add other variable declarations:

```
// retrieve json data
let json;
```

	- add main entry point method to bottom of main.js:

```
function main() {
}
main();
```

	- startup watcher for all JS / Sass files via command:

```
npm run start
```

	- webpack transpiles JS and pre-processes Sass and all are bundled
into bundle.js / bundle.css

	- point out webpack fires up its own webpack-dev-server and opens web
app at localhost:3000

	- previous course we used port 5000

	- point out /build folder created with bundles

	- point out spinner animating

	- commit changes to GIT repo with message "Spinner and main entry
method"

	- let's request JSON data from the web API via our handy Toolkit
library

	- recall the getJSONData() method is imported to be used

	- add to bottom of main():

```
getJSONData(QUOTE_API, onLoaded, onError);
```

	- this method sends out an AJAX request to QUOTE_API URL and calls
onloaded() when the data is received or onError() if error

	- add event handlers above:

```js
//
----------------------------------------------------
event handlers
function onLoaded(result) {
console.log(result);
// console.table(result);
}
function onError(message) {
console.log(`*** Error has occurred \| Message: ${message}`);
}
```

	- point out string interpolation with \${message}

	- run web app and point received array of objects (JSON) from API
appearing in console

	- commit changes with message "Data retrieval from Web API"

	- add to bottom of onLoaded() event handler:

```
let loadingOverlay = document.querySelector(".loading-overlay");
loadingOverlay.style.display = "none";
```

	- run web app and show overlay disappearing

	- commit changes to GIT repo with message "Loading Overlay
implemented"

	- let's work with the received data!

	- result argument of onLoaded() is a giant array of objects of all
the received data -- perfect for working with our web app

	- this is what makes JSON data format so awesome!

	- store result argument in global variable at top of onLoaded():

```
json = result;
```

	- add to onLoaded() event handler:

buildOutput();

	- buildOutput() is a private method to isolate the data in the
received JSON and populate interface

	- add buildOutput() method:

```js
//
----------------------------------------------
private methods
function buildOutput() {
for (let n=0; n<3; n++) {
let quoteTemplate = document.getElementById("quoteTemplate");
// clone it
let quoteNode = quoteTemplate.cloneNode(true);
let quoteData = json[n];
let {id,author,quote,permalink} = quoteData;
quoteNode.id = `quote${id}`;
// populate it using HTML DOM
quoteNode.getElementsByClassName("template__message")[0].innerHTML
= `"${quote}"`;
quoteNode.getElementsByClassName("template__author")[0].innerHTML
= author;
quoteNode.getElementsByTagName("a")[0].innerHTML = permalink;
quoteNode.getElementsByTagName("a")[0].href = permalink;
// make it visible now
quoteNode.style.display = "block";
// append it to the content div
document.querySelector(".quotes").appendChild(quoteNode);
}
}
```

	- point out looping through first three objects of JSON array

	- point out cloning quoteTemplate \<div\>

	- point out using Object Destructuring to isolate all properties of
quoteData into local variables id, title, content, link

	- point out changing id of quote (cloned \<div\>)

	- point out updating quote (cloned \<div\>) with data using HTML DOM
innerHTML, etc.

	- am targeting HTML nodes using getElementsByClassName() /
getElementsByTagName() for review purposes

	- could have used querySelector() / querySelectorAll()

	- point out changing display style prop of quote \<div- to block

	- point out appending quote \<div- to \<div- with class=quotes

	- run web app and demonstrate working app

	- commit changes to GIT repo with message "Working quote generator"

CHALLENGE : Randomize the Quote Generator

- our Quote Generator web app is successfully display three quotes
fetched from retrieved JSON data, but it isn't displaying random quotes!
Currently it always displays the first three quotes of the JSON data.

- your challenge is to modify the buildOutput() method so that it
displays three random quotes

- be sure to use the handy getRandom() method of the Toolkit.js library
in your solution!

- don't worry if duplicate quotes are generated -- we will address this
later!

- see /quoteGeneratorDone for solution

CHALLENGE : Installing Docker on your machine

- let's get docker installed and ready to go for next lesson!

- your challenge is to install and configure everything needed to start
using docker next lesson

- for Windows OS, here are the steps:

1.  Download and install Docker Desktop from
    [www.docker.com](http://www.docker.com)

The docker engine needs to run on Linux. As a result, the installation
also configures WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) which is essentially
a service that runs Linux virtually on your windows machine

2.  Run docker and it will require installation of the Linux Kernel.
    Follow the link provided, download the MSI and install the kernel.
    Docker will eventually start up -- but it does take some time!

3.  Because Docker's engine runs on Linux, in order for code watching to
    work (detecting changes in your code and refreshing automatically)
    you need to develop your full stack web apps in this course on Linux
    as well. Luckily you can install a distro of Ubuntu to run on WSL as
    well. Download and install Ubuntu from the Microsoft App Store
    <https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV>

4.  By default, Ubuntu will be installed to run on WSL1, but we need it
    to run on WSL2 like Docker. You can see what WSL version all the
    distros are running on with the following command:

wsl \--list \--verbose

To change ubuntu distro to run on WSL version 2, run the following
command:

wsl \--set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2

Note that the "Ubuntu-20.04" is the name of the installed ubuntu
distro and it may be slightly different on your machine.

After the WSL version is converted, you can check to make sure it
worked with the list command again.

5.  Two settings in docker desktop need to be adjusted:

    -   Set docker to use docker-compose version 2 (settings / general)

    -   Set docker to be able to integrate with the ubuntu distro in WSL
        (settings / resources / WSL Integration)

- for MacOS, here are the steps:

1.  Congratulations! All you need to do is download and install Docker
    Desktop from [www.docker.com](http://www.docker.com)

That is it, for now -- we will explore the docker workflow next
lesson...
